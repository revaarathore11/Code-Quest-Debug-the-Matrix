A 5-Level Bug-Catching Game

A browser-based game that gamifies debugging and problem-solving.

📌 Overview

Debugger Dash is a grid-based browser game where players catch bugs, avoid obstacles, and progress through 5 increasingly challenging levels.
The goal is to make debugging concepts fun, visual, and interactive.

🎯 Problem Statement

Debugging concepts often feel abstract for beginners.
This project solves that by converting debugging into a visual game, helping players think like programmers through active interaction.
